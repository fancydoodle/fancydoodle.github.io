the great thing about fancydoodle is its ease of use

you can toggle between two modes, 'draw' and 'text' 

each mode has a selection of tools and accompanying keyboard shortcuts

if you click the info button top left a modal pops up with helpful reminders of what they are and what they do 

fancydoodle is made for fun and experimentation

you can make a mess - drawing random lines everywhere - which can be quite relaxing

or you can be more structured and create designs

being able to combine text, lines, shapes and colours on a blank canvas is incredibly playful and freeing

especially with the app in full screen

download it. play around. enjoy yourself

cheers
